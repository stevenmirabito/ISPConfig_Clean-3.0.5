ISPConfig_Clean-3.0.5
=====================

Clean theme for ISPConfig 3.0.5 and above, tweaked by Steven Mirabito. Credit for the original theme goes to Drew Clardy (dclardy64).

Installation
------------

1. Copy the interface folder to your /usr/local/ispconfig/
2. Edit /usr/local/ispconfig/interface/lib/config.inc.php default theme to ispc-clean
3. Edit the header logo location. Change default to ispc-clean is all that needs to be done.
4. Import the SQL file inside of the SQL folder to setup the table structure in the ISPConfig Database.
5. Enjoy the theme. I will be making changes as I have time.
